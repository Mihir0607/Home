   <h1> Travelling: ravel is easy enough to spell, but the words traveling,
    traveler, and traveled are a common cause of confusion because some people spell
    them with one l while others use two.It’s wonderful to travel—to meet new people, see new places,
    experience different cultures, live life the way life is lived somewhere else. Plenty of good things
    are associated with travel, but there’s one particular issue that can make traveling 
    annoying: the spelling.
